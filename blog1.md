## My Favorite Planet
During My trip in the outer edges of the galaxy I came across a small star system with only a sole planet within.
This was already exciting for me as the system wasn't on any map I knew and was potentially undocumented (I later found out I was not the first to find it and the system was recently discovered just a bit before I arrived). The planet looked like it could be explorable so I eagerly scanned the planet's surface for potential landing zones and descended. Once on the surface, I was blown away by what I saw, so much so I struggle to put it into words. The colors alone was a sight of awe as in any direction you look you would be able to see all the colors of the spectrum. It was also a huge surprise to find the beginnings of terestrial lifeforms on the surface. I unfortunately do not own proper testing equipment, but with redimentary tests I found things that largely resembled low level plants like
mosses and grasses. By this point, I was beginning to lose light and had to pack my things. \

Though brief, the impression left on me by that planet is one that will be difficult to match and one I will always remember.
