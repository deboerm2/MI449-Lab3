## Space Travel
Travelling across the galaxy can be difficult, expensive, and even dangerous without the proper know how to get around. All of these problems become even larger if choosing to travel alone like myself. Not to worry, today I want to write down a few tips and tricks
to help overcome or ease the difficulties of galactic travel so that you can travel with confidence and safety, and enjoy the
beauty that's there.\
\
**Money**\
Money is the number one reason I find that people don't end up travelling the galaxy and it certainly can be expensive to buy your own spacecraft. However, You don't need the latest and greatest tech, Even the cheapest of ships can often be more than enough to explore your local star cluster. Just be sure that the ship you buy can still satisfy basic needs and saftey standards as a lot of cheap ships are meant to be sold a scrap and are either pretty damaged or even outright disfunctional.\

**Encountering New Planets**\
While it can be very exciting when you find a planet you haven't been too, It is very important to know some things about the planet's surface to ensure your saftey. First is whether the atmosphere facilitates a hospitable environment, things like temperature, atmospheric makeup, and structural integrity of the ground are often the first things I look at to even land my ship. After landing, I make sure to sweep around the landing area to identify any traces of potentially hostile creatures or people. Once deemed safe, your free to explore, though I recomend you never stray too far away from you ship unless the planet is very developed and even then you need to think about thieves.\

I hope the information here will help at least a few of you travel safely and maybe even convince you to travel yourself around the galaxy.
